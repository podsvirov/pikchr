# The "thick" and "thin" attributes

The "`thick`" and "`thin`" attributes increase or decrease the stroke-width
for the lines used to draw an object.  There can be multiple "`thick`" or
"`thin`" attributes - the effects are cumulative.

# The `solid` attribute

The "`solid`" attribute changes the stroke-width back to its default,
and it disables "`dashed`" and "`dotted`".
